# Quotes-Application-Django-
An application that lets users post famous quotations, move favorite quotes to a list, remove them back from the list and see all the quotes posted by any user. Validations are applied to a quote before getting posted. The app can be considered the version 2 for a simpler application I built for the Coding Dojo Belt Exam (hence the package names). This version incorporates a Bootstrap grid for better look and feel. 

Needs python/Django/SQLite to run. I'm hoping to enhance it further and will add more details once I get a chance to. Feel free to use it to learn more about the basics of Django. Most of the application source code is located in "Belt_Exam/apps/belt_exam_app/". Take a look at models.py for an illustration of how this application manages entity relationships.

I created a video of version 1 here some time ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqC8xgRObIc. The current version does not have a video yet, hoping to create one soon :).
